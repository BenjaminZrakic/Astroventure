From what we know of Uranus, it seems it was hit by a titanic collision millions of years ago causing it to rotate around it's axis at a jaw dropping 97.7 degree angle. We believe this collision might have left traces on the planet of whatever it was that hit it. Your goal is to collect it. We don't know where this object came from or what it is or how it will interact with other elements of our Solar system , so be prepared for anything.
